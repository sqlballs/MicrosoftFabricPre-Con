# 07.1 - Understanding Copilots & AI Skills in Microsoft Fabric

In this section, we will explore the **Copilot** and **AI Skills** features within Microsoft Fabric, highlighting their differences, use cases, and how they can enhance your data workflows.  At the time of the publishing of this course, both **Copilot** and **AI Skills** require an F64 capacity in order to utilize their functionality.

## What is Copilot?

**Copilot** acts as an intelligent assistant designed to streamline various tasks within Microsoft Fabric. It provides real-time support for data professionals by:

- **Generating SQL Queries**: Copilot can help you write SQL code quickly and efficiently, making it easier to interact with your data.
- **Code Completion**: It offers contextual suggestions as you type, reducing the time spent on routine coding tasks.
- **Troubleshooting and Documentation**: Copilot assists in debugging and provides documentation references to help you understand complex processes.



## What is AI Skill?

**AI Skill** is a tool that allows users to configure a generative AI assistant tailored to their specific data needs. Key features include:

- **Natural Language Processing**: Users can ask questions in plain language, and AI Skill generates the corresponding SQL queries.
- **Customization**: You can configure AI Skill to include business context, making it adaptable to your organizationâ€™s requirements.
- **Accessibility**: AI Skill enables non-technical users to interact with data without needing SQL knowledge, fostering a self-service data culture.

For more information, visit the AI Skill creation guide (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/get-started/copilot-fabric-overview).

## Difference between an AI skill and a copilot
The technology behind the AI skill and the Fabric copilots is similar. They both use generative AI to reason over data. They also have some key differences:

- Configuration: With an AI skill, you can configure the AI to behave the way you need. You can provide it with instructions and examples that tune it to your specific use case. A Fabric copilot doesn't offer this configuration flexibility.

- Use case: A copilot can help you do your work on Fabric. It can help you generate notebook code or data warehouse queries. In contrast, the AI skill operates independently. You can eventually connect it to Microsoft Teams and other areas outside of Fabric.

<h2 id="7-3"><img style="float: left; margin: 0px 15px 15px 0px;" src="../graphics/pencil2.png">7.3 Microsoft Fabric AI Skill</h2>

With the Microsoft Fabric AI skill, you can make data more accessible to your colleagues. You can configure a generative AI system to generate queries that answer questions about your data. After you configure the AI skill, you can share it with your colleagues, who can then ask their questions in plain English. Based on their questions, the AI generates queries over your data that answer those questions.

## How the AI skill works
The AI skill relies on generative AI, specifically, large language models (LLMs). These LLMs can generate queries, for example, T-SQL queries, based on a specific schema and a question. The system sends a question in the AI skill, information about the selected data (including the table and column names, and the data types found in the tables) to the LLM. Next, it requests generation of a T-SQL query that answers the question. Parse the generated query to first ensure that it doesn't change the data in any way. Then execute that query. Finally, show the query execution results. An AI skill is intended to access specific database resources, and then generate and execute relevant T-SQL queries.

## AI skill configuration
Think of the AI skill as you might think about Power BI reports. You first build the report, and then you share the report with your colleagues who can consume it to get their data insights. The AI skill works in a similar way. You need to first create and configure the AI skill. Then, you can share it with your colleagues.

You should expect to handle some necessary configuration steps before the AI skill works properly. An AI skill can often provide out-of-the-box answers to reasonable questions, but it could provide incorrect answers for your specific situation. Incorrect answers typically occur because the AI is missing context about your company, setup, or definition of key terms. To solve the problem, provide the AI with instructions and example question-query pairs. You can use these powerful techniques to guide the AI to the right answers.
