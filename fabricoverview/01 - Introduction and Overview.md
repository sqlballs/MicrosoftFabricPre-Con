Microsoft Fabric is an all-in-one analytics solution for enterprises that covers everything from data movement to data science, Real-Time Analytics, and business intelligence. It offers a comprehensive suite of services, including data lake, data engineering, data integration, data science, data warehouse, real-time analytics, and Power BI. It is built on a foundation of Software as a Service (SaaS), which simplifies, integrates, and secures the analytics needs of organizations. Microsoft Fabric is in preview and brings together new and existing components from Power BI, Azure Synapse, and Azure Data Factory into a single integrated environment. These components are then presented in various customized user experiences, such as Data Engineering, Data Factory, Data Science, Data Warehouse, Real-Time Analytics, and Power BI. Fabric also provides a unified data lake that allows users to retain, access, and share data across different experiences and clouds. Users can also create their own workspaces and lakehouses within OneLake, the data lake, and mount existing PaaS storage accounts into OneLake with the Shortcut feature. This way, users can enjoy a highly integrated, end-to-end, and easy-to-use product that is designed to turn large and complex data repositories into actionable workloads and analytics.

<h2 id="1.2"><img style="float: left; margin: 0px 15px 15px 0px;" src="../graphics/pencil2.png">1.2 Basic Concepts in Microsoft Fabric</h2>

Organizations are faced with multiple challenges in bringing together all data from their environment for actionable intelligence. There are many data professionals involved across the organization working with various data sources, tools, and processes, and Fabric brings together all these experiences into a unified platform to offer the most comprehensive big data analytics platform in the industry. 

Microsoft Fabric enables organizations, and individuals, to turn large and complex data repositories into actionable workloads and analytics, and is an implementation of a *[data mesh](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/scenarios/cloud-scale-analytics/architectures/what-is-data-mesh)* architecture. It provides various systems with associated tools and aspects to the data professionals in their day-to-day work:

- *Data Engineering* - Fabric provides a Spark platform with a simplified but powerful authoring experiences, enabling data engineers to perform large scale data transformation and democratize data through the lakehouse. Microsoft Fabric Spark's integration with *Data Factory* enables notebooks and spark jobs to be scheduled and orchestrated. 

- *Data Pipelines* - *Fabric Data Factory* combines the simplicity of *Power Query* with the scale and power of Azure Data Factory. You can use more than 200 native connectors to connect to data sources on-premises and in the cloud.

- *Data Science* - Various tools for Data Science in Mmicrosoft Fabric enables you to build, deploy, and operationalize machine learning models. It integrates with Azure Machine Learning to provide built-in experiment tracking and model registry. Data scientists can enrich organizational data with predictions and allow business analysts to integrate those predictions into their BI reports. Microsoft Fabric allows you to work from descriptive to predictive insights. 

- *Data Warehouse* - Microsoft Fabric provides a Data Warehouse using SQL, with high performance and scale. It fully separates compute from storage, enabling independent scaling of both the components. Additionally, it natively stores data in the open Delta Lake format. 

- *Real-Time Analytics* - Observational data, which is collected from various sources such as apps, IoT devices, human interactions, and so many more. It's currently the fastest growing data category. This data is often semi-structured in formats like JSON or Text. It comes in at high volume, with shifting schemas. These characteristics make it hard for traditional data warehousing platforms to work with. *Real-Time Analytics* is best in class engine for observational data analytics. 

- Power BI - *Power BI* is the world's leading Business Intelligence platform. It ensures that business owners can access all the data in Fabric quickly and intuitively to make better decisions with data.
