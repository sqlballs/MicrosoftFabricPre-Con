Welcome to this Microsoft solutions workshop on Microsoft Fabric for the Data Professional. Microsoft Fabric is an end-to-end analytics solution with full-service capabilities including data movement, data lakes, data engineering, data integration, data science, real-time analytics, and business intelligenceâ€”all backed by a shared platform providing robust data security, governance, and compliance.

In this workshop, you'll learn what the Microsoft Fabric platform is, the various services and components it contains, how to create, use and manage a deployment, from the point of view of the data professional.

The focus of this workshop is to understand how to use Microsoft Fabric in a solution, focusing on the data aspects of the platform. 

You'll start with an introduction to Microsoft Fabric, move on to understanding Workspaces, user security, and data governance. From there you'll learn about the Data Lakehouse, and then understand the developer and user experience of Microsoft Fabric. You'll end with a section on the DevOps of a Microsoft Fabric solution, with a focus on how to extrapolate what you have learned to create other solutions for your organization.

This github README.MD file explains how the workshop is laid out, what you will learn, and the technologies you will use in this solution.

In this workshop you'll cover these topics:

- Introduction and Overview:	Introduction of the Workshop, Basic Concepts, Services, Roles, Benchmarks. Verification of pre-requisites
- Data Warehouse and Data Integration:	Understanding and creating Workspaces, creating a Data Warehouse, connecting and managing, ingesting data with pipelines and data flows
- The Data Lakehouse:	Creating a Lakehouse, Linking data, using Spark to create new data sets in the Lakehouse
- The Fabric Developer Experience:	Using Co-Pilot, SSMS, VS Code, and development best-practices
- Real-Time Analytics with Microsoft Fabric: Working with Azure Data Explorer in Microsoft Fabric, Working with Fabric and Streaming / Event Data, and Working with Fabric and the Kusto Query Language (KQL)
- Microsoft Fabric DevOps: Design, Sizing, Monitoring and Management, Source Control, and the EXPLAIN command.

The goal of this workshop is to train the data professional to get an overview on how to determine when to implement a Microsoft Fabric solution, how to design the solution, implement it, use it, and manage, monitor and maintain it.

In each *Module*, you will find *Sections* that have topics, concepts and technologies that you will cover throughout the Workshop. You will also find various *Activities* where you willwork through hands-on steps to learn the material. You will also see *Self-Guided Activities* that you should complete after an in-person experience, or along the way if you are taking this Workshop directly from this GitHub repository.

The solution includes the following technologies - although you are not limited to these, they form the basis of the workshop. At the end of the workshop you will learn how to extrapolate these components into other solutions. You will cover these at an overview level, with references to much deeper training provided.

You'll need a local system that you are able to install software on. The workshop demonstrations use Microsoft Windows as an operating system and all examples use Windows for the workshop. Optionally, you can use a Microsoft Azure Virtual Machine (VM) to install the software on and work with the solution.

- You must have a Microsoft Azure account with the ability to create assets.
- You will need a laptop to work through the examples, access the workshop materials, and take notes.

This workshop expects that you understand data architectures, working with large data sets, data security, data analysis, and data pipelines.

If you are new to these, here are a few references you can complete prior to class:

-  [Big Data Architectures](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/data-guide/big-data/)
-  [Pipelines](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/data-guide/technology-choices/pipeline-orchestration-data-movement)
-  [Data Security](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/data-guide/scenarios/securing-data-solutions)
-  [Data Analysis](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/solution-ideas/articles/analytics-start-here)

<a href="https://github.com/sqlballs/MicrosoftFabricPre-Con/blob/main/fabricoverview/00%20-%20Pre-Requisites.md" >A full pre-requisites document is located here</a>. These instructions should be completed before the workshop starts, since you will not have time to cover these in class. <i>Remember to turn off any Virtual Machines from the Azure Portal when not taking the class so that you do incur charges (shutting down the machine in the VM itself is not sufficient)</i>.
